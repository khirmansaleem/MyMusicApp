================== FAST API BACKEND and How it works ==========================================
===============================================================================================
FastAPI ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 the backend brain that connects your Flutter frontend
 and your PostgreSQL database, handles authentication, keeps data secure, 
 and provides all the routes your app needs.
 ===============================================================================================
Hosting your FastAPI server means keeping your backend code running on a cloud computer,
so your Flutter frontend can safely talk to it — instead of talking to the database directly.
=================================================================================================
===> Hosting is paid because you’re renting a 24/7 internet-connected machine
 to keep your FastAPI backend alive.
 ================================================================================================
 when you use async and await, your function can pause at slow operations 
 and let the server handle other tasks in the meantime
  — that’s what makes FastAPI fast and scalable.
  ================================================================================================
  In One Line:
======================================================
Using Pydantic models to access request bodies is faster, safer, 
and much cleaner than manually reading the body
==================================================================================================
 — because FastAPI handles parsing, validation, and error reporting
  automatically.

Authentication persistence
=============================================
Whether the app remembers that you’re logged in
✅ Saved JWT token
====================================================
UI / Form Persistence
=======================================================
------------------------------------------------------
Whether your email/password fields remain filled
⚙️ Saved form data (not auth state)
==========================================================
If a valid JWT exists on the client, the app treats the user
as already logged in and skips the login screen.

When the JWT is deleted or expires, the app redirects back
to the login screen.
=================================================================
So what JWT actually ensures

Persistence of login state → User stays logged in until logout or expiry

Statelessness → Server doesn’t need to remember sessions

Security → Only valid, untampered tokens grant access

==================================================================
The client decides which screen to show (login or home) based on whether
 a token exists.

The server decides whether the token is still valid.

If valid → home data loads normally.

If invalid → server says “401 Unauthorized,” and the client redirects
back to login.
